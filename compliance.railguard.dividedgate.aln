module compliance.railguard.dividedgate
    monitor all networkparams, endpoints, channels in realtime
    enforce operation_mode "strict"
    for each endpoint, param:
        if destination not in allowed_local_jurisdiction and not in civil_authority_registry and not in federal_approved:
            quarantine connection
            log event to blockchain_audit, notify oversight
            deny access, escalate only to compliance_officer_panel
        require encryption quantum+tls_1.4 min, zero-trust routing, authenticated
        enforce endpoint tagging: geo_location, jurisdictional_tags, rights_profile
        for data packets:
            auto-inspect meta for ethical, statutory, and rights-compliance
            block/alert on non-compliance, policy_deviation, or attempted escalation
        trigger auto-failsafe if bypass/hijack detected: isolate network segment, force endpoint shutdown, require multi-sign re-enable
    require continuous audit log export to local, civil, and (where justified) federal authoritiesâ€”never exceeding scope of strictest applicable law or user rights
    periodic review of rights_profile tags to adapt for newly codified ethical/human/legal standards
    fallback: if conflict of laws/rights detected, default to maximal protection for god-given, constitutional, and international rights; sandbox questionable actions for human-in-the-loop arbitration
