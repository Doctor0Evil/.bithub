Compliance controls for ALN (Assistance Listing Number) misuse include system-level field validation, audit logs, reporting requirements, and immutable linkage to federal grant records. Below is a cmd script for ALN validation, federal mandates summary, audit verification procedures, and a training checklist.[1]

***

## Compliance Controls Preventing ALN Misuse

- **Field Validation:** Systems force entry of legitimate ALNs only, checked against the official SAM.gov directory.[1]
- **Immutable Recordkeeping:** ALN assignments are locked to grant records and cannot be arbitrarily edited.
- **Audit Logging:** All ALN changes are logged for government review.
- **Reporting Requirements:** Grants must report using ALN for every expenditure and program action.[1]
- **Automated Notifications:** Systems flag and report errors if ALN is missing, mistyped, or deprecated.

## Windows CMD Script: Automate ALN Validation

```batch
@echo off
REM =============== ALN Validation Script ===============
REM Usage: ALNvalidate.cmd <ALN_number>
REM Validates ALN syntax, logs results, prevents grant submission if invalid.

setlocal EnableExtensions
set ALNLIST=aln_directory.txt

if "%~1"=="" (
    echo ERROR: Please provide an ALN number.
    exit /b 1
)

findstr /R /C:"^%~1$" %ALNLIST% >nul
if ERRORLEVEL 1 (
    echo INVALID ALN: %~1 not found in official directory.
    echo LOGGING: %DATE% %TIME% - Invalid ALN %~1 attempted >> ALN_audit.log
    exit /b 2
) else (
    echo VALID ALN: %~1 is verified.
    echo LOGGING: %DATE% %TIME% - Valid ALN %~1 used >> ALN_audit.log
)
endlocal
exit /b 0
```
- Save the current ALN list from SAM.gov to `aln_directory.txt` for reference.[1]
- Call as `ALNvalidate.cmd 21.027` to automate.

***

## Federal Mandates on ALN Auditing

- Federal mandates require exclusive use of ALN for all grant audits and submissions; CFDA use is deprecated.[1]
- All grant records, financial reports, and audit schedules must reference the correct ALN as listed in agency award notices.
- Mandates specify that failure to use ALN can result in rejected reports, findings, and penalties for noncompliance.

***

## Procedures to Verify ALN Before Audit Submission

1. Download the latest ALN directory from SAM.gov before audit season.[1]
2. Cross-check every recorded ALN in grant records against official listing.
3. Run the validation script across recipient and subrecipient files.
4. Correct and re-log any mismatches before finalizing the audit packet.
5. Retain audit logs and confirmation documentation for reviewer access.

## ALN Compliance Training Checklist

- Recognize ALN format and importance.
- Identify program-specific ALNs in agency award notices.
- Access and navigate SAM.gov ALN directory.
- Practice ALN validation using scripts and system utilities.
- Understand federal mandates for exclusive ALN usage.
- Set audit logs for all ALN entries/edits.
- Prepare pre-audit ALN verification procedures.
- Retain records for post-audit review and findings.
- Ensure recurring staff refreshers on ALN protocols and audit impacts.[1]

These controls, procedures, and tools will ensure robust grant compliance and protect against ALN misuse, audit risks, and eligibility conflicts in federal grant management.[1]
