The effects of **Nature's Curse** differ between Divinity: Original Sin and Divinity: Original Sin 2, evolving from a straightforward skill to a complex mechanic that interacts with environmental surfaces and player strategy.[1][2][3][4]

## Original Sin: Nature's Curse Skill

- **Skill Function**: Nature's Curse in Divinity: Original Sin is a Geomancer spell with a 100% chance to inflict the "Curse" status on all nearby enemies.[5][1]
- **Curse Effects**: Enemies affected by Curse have a reduced chance to hit (-30%) and are more susceptible to negative outcomes in combat.[1]
- **Application**: Used mainly for direct debuffing in encounters, providing party-wide advantage against clustered foes.[5]

## Original Sin 2: Curse Status Effect

- **No Geomancer Spell**: In Original Sin 2, there isn't a direct "Nature’s Curse" Geomancer spell—the curse effect is broader, often applied via surfaces, items, or enemy abilities.[2][4]
- **Curse Mechanics**: Characters or surfaces can become "Cursed" through various means. Cursed status reduces accuracy, dodging, and elemental resistances, making targets highly vulnerable in combat.[3]
- **Environmental Surfaces**: Many surfaces (fire, water, oil, blood, steam, poison) can be blessed or cursed, creating new effects such as Necrofire, diseased water, or acid damage.[6][4]
- **Cleansing**: "Bless" is required to remove curse and cleanse surfaces, making management of Curse a strategic part of gameplay.[7][3]

| Nature's Curse Skill           | Direct Geomancer spell, curses nearby enemies [1] | No direct spell; curse is a broader mechanic [2] |
| Effect on Enemies              | -30% chance to hit, debuff [1]               | Reduced accuracy, dodging, and resistances [3] |
| Environmental Impact           | None                                              | Surfaces can be cursed with additional effects [4][6]|

Divinity: Original Sin 2 transforms Curse into an environmental and tactical hazard, requiring careful surface and status management, compared to the simpler debuff spell in the original game.[4][2][6][3][1]
