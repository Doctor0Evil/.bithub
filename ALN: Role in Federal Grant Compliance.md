The Assistance Listing Number (ALN) plays a pivotal role in federal grant compliance by providing a standardized identifier for all federal assistance awards, including grants and cooperative agreements. Each ALN helps agencies track, report, and audit federal expenditures, ensures program eligibility, and provides transparency in grant operations.[1][2][3][4][5]

## ALN: Role in Federal Grant Compliance

The **ALN** is used to uniquely identify each federal funding program and facilitate regulatory compliance, reporting, and audits. Agencies must report grant use by ALN, maintain records, and ensure funds are used as specified by the program's requirements. ALN assignment enables oversight and helps agencies follow Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200), including cost principles, procurement standards, and audit requirements.[4][5][6][1]

## Validating ALN for Funding Eligibility

To validate an ALN:
- Refer to the grant award notice, where the ALN is clearly listed.[2][5]
- Use the official ALN directory on SAM.gov to confirm the program’s eligibility and requirements.[5][7]
- Ensure the ALN is active, matches the funding opportunity, and aligns with the appropriate agency and program purpose.[8][6]
- Agencies may contact their financial reporting analyst or use internal compliance systems to confirm the ALN is valid for expenditures.[8]

## ALN vs CFDA Numbers: Key Differences

| Feature            | ALN (Assistance Listing Number)               | CFDA (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance)       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Current Usage      | Official identifier for federal assistance    | Phased out; replaced by ALN after CFDA.gov closure  |
| Format             | Five-digit, e.g., 21.027                     | Similar five-digit format, e.g., 21.027             |
| Directory Platform | SAM.gov                                      | Previously cfda.gov                                 |
| Award Notices      | Listed in all grant/cooperative agreements    | Listed prior to transition to ALN                   |
| Reporting          | Required for all current compliance/reporting | No longer accepted for new grants                   |[8][1][5][9]

## Finding the Official ALN Directory

The authoritative, up-to-date ALN directory is on **SAM.gov’s Assistance Listings portal**. This replaces the older CFDA.gov site and includes searchable listings of all federal programs, eligibility details, and statutory requirements. Visit https://sam.gov/content/assistance-listings.[7][5]

## ALN Reporting Requirements for Grant Recipients

Recipients must:
- Track all grant expenditures using ALN for accurate reporting.[6][4]
- Report financial and programmatic data by ALN to government portals, such as FSRS and USASpending.gov.[10]
- File regular progress and expenditure reports, as specified by the awarding agency and ALN program requirements.[11][6][10]
- Maintain documentation of subawards, use ALN in single audits if threshold is met, and adhere to program deadlines and procurement guidelines for compliance.[4][10][8]

These rules ensure transparent operations, proper use of federal funds, and informed eligibility verification for grant recipients and oversight entities.[1][5][6][10][4]
