# AI legal team operations manual with legallyblind mode for windows-scale nano-deployments

This manual defines a policy-driven, rights-aware legal and compliance framework embedded into Windows 13–scale nano-deployment pipelines. It formalizes terms, permissions, and parent/child privilege inheritance; enforces neutral, auditable behavior via legallyblind mode; and adapts across corporate, public-sector, and defense-adjacent ecosystems without enabling unlawful use. Human counsel retains final authority.

---

## Governance, scope, and core terms

- **Purpose:** Establish a lawful, auditable operating model for AI-assisted legal documentation, compliance filings, and court-ready materials integrated with deployment automation.
- **Scope:** Applies to all nano-deployment pipelines, legal artifacts, compliance evidence, audit logs, and consent records across environments (workstation, VDI, server, edge).
- **Authority:** Human General Counsel (GC) and Compliance Officer approve policies; AI systems act only within approved policy envelopes and jurisdictional constraints.
- **Legallyblind mode:** Neutrality and rights filter that blocks biased, manipulative, or out-of-scope outputs; requires rights impact checks and multi-party sign-off for high-impact actions.
- **Non-derogation:** Nothing herein authorizes unauthorized practice of law, evasion of due process, or extra-legal actions. Jurisdictional rules and professional standards prevail.
- **Change control:** All updates proceed through signed, reviewed change requests with reproducible builds and verifiable provenance.

## Role, permission, and inheritance model

### Role taxonomy (parent → child)

| Role | Parent | Core capabilities | Prohibited capabilities |
|---|---|---|---|
| GC_Approver | — | Approve legal filings; define policy; authorize exceptions | Draft without review; operate unattended in prod |
| Compliance_Officer | — | Map controls; validate evidence; approve compliance filings | Change product code; alter audit records |
| Legal_Oversight_Council | — | Final review for high-impact actions; ethics review | Execute deployments |
| AI_Legal_Drafter | Policy_Bound_AI | Draft filings; generate transcripts; assemble exhibits | Submit to courts; bypass oversight |
| Policy_Bound_AI | — | Apply policies; run rights impact and bias checks | Execute actions outside policy scope |
| Deployment_Admin | — | Manage pipelines; approve releases; rotate keys (non-data) | Access case data; modify legal content |
| Evidence_Custodian | — | Manage WORM storage; certify chain-of-custody | Edit content post-seal |
| Reader_Audit | — | Read-only access to logs, policies, evidence | Write/modify resources |

> Inheritance: Children inherit only read scopes from parents unless explicitly granted. No child may inherit submit/execute privileges from GC_Approver or Compliance_Officer.

### Permission classes

- **Read-Only:** View policies, logs, evidence, filings, deployment status.
- **Draft:** Generate new legal artifacts in a quarantined workspace.
- **Review:** Comment/approve drafts without edit to final sealed copies.
- **Seal:** Cryptographically sign and move artifacts to WORM evidence.
- **Transmit:** Submit to approved channels (court e-file portals, tax e-file, regulators) with dual control.
- **Operate:** Execute pipeline stages (build/test/promote) without access to legal content.
- **Break-glass (legal):** Restricted, quorum-based access to sealed evidence for court orders or subpoenas.

### Separation of duties

- **Draft vs. Approve:** AI_Legal_Drafter cannot approve or transmit. GC_Approver and Compliance_Officer cannot run deployments.
- **Operate vs. Custody:** Deployment_Admin cannot access or alter sealed evidence; Evidence_Custodian cannot deploy code.
- **Quorum rules:** Any transmit/seal action requires 2-person approval from distinct domains (Legal + Compliance).

## Windows 13 nano-deployment pipeline with legal/compliance gates

#### Pipeline stages

1. **Intake**
   - **Inputs:** Change request, jurisdiction, filing type, datasets, policies.
   - **Checks:** Schema validation, classification, data minimization.

2. **Draft (AI-assisted, sandboxed)**
   - **Controls:** Legallyblind mode on; WDAC and HVCI enforced; no outbound egress except approved legal references cache.
   - **Outputs:** Draft filings, exhibits, citations, rights impact summary.

3. **Review**
   - **Approvers:** Legal_Oversight_Council + Compliance_Officer.
   - **Controls:** Bias scan, citation verification, jurisdictional rule checks.

4. **Seal**
   - **Process:** FIPS-validated signing; timestamping; WORM storage write.
   - **Artifacts:** Sealed PDF/XML, hash manifests, policy snapshot, signer list.

5. **Transmit**
   - **Channels:** Court e-file, regulator portals, tax e-file; TLS 1.3 mTLS; metadata-minimized payloads.
   - **Evidence:** Receipt IDs, ACKs, delivery proofs, audit linkage.

6. **Deploy (nano)**
   - **Scope:** Policy updates, policy engines, consent prompts, logging agents; no application feature code mingled with legal artifacts.
   - **Gates:** OPA/ALN pass; WDAC policy loaded; AppLocker rules; signed package verification; rollback markers.

7. **Post-Transmission & Runtime Monitoring**
   - **Actions:** Confirm acceptance, docket numbers; monitor policy drift; auto-rollback on violation; quarterly drills.

#### Windows 13 host controls (illustrative)

- **WDAC/AppLocker:** Allow-list legal toolchain; deny unsigned binaries.
- **VBS/HVCI/Credential Guard:** Isolate secrets and signing keys.
- **LSA Protection/Defender for Endpoint:** EDR with legal-data-aware DLP.
- **WORM evidence store:** NTFS Object Lock or compliant equivalent with retention policies.

## Policy-as-code and enforcement snippets

### OPA/Rego: legallyblind gating and transmit quorum

```rego
package legal.pipeline

default allow := false

deny[msg] {
  input.stage == "draft"
  not input.legallyblind.enabled
  msg := "Legallyblind mode must be enabled for all drafts."
}

deny[msg] {
  input.stage == "review"
  input.bias.detected
  msg := "Bias detected; revise before review."
}

deny[msg] {
  input.stage == "seal"
  not input.citations.verified
  msg := "All citations must be verified."
}

deny[msg] {
  input.stage == "transmit"
  count(input.approvals) < 2
  msg := "Transmit requires dual independent approvals."
}

deny[msg] {
  input.stage == "transmit"
  not input.jurisdiction.permits_pro_se
  input.representation.mode == "pro_se_ai_assisted"
  msg := "Jurisdiction does not permit AI-assisted pro se pathway."
}

allow {
  not deny[_]
}

## Evidence, consent, and neutrality controls

- **Consent records**
  - **Explicitness:** Each action stores purpose, scope, legal basis, retention.
  - **Revocation:** Immediate halt and quarantine on withdrawal in applicable contexts.
  - **Visibility:** User-facing notices in clear language; translations as needed.

- **Immutable audit**
  - **Sealing:** SHA-256/512 hashes; RFC 3161 timestamps; signer identities.
  - **Chain-of-custody:** Event sequence: Draft → Review → Seal → Transmit, each with actor, time, and policy snapshot.
  - **Access:** Reader_Audit role with just-enough context; no PII exposure beyond necessity.

- **Legallyblind safeguards**
  - **Bias guard:** Model and output audits; protected attribute redaction where irrelevant.
  - **Scope guard:** Jurisdictional checklists; pro se rules; filing venue constraints.
  - **Language guard:** Neutral phrasing enforcement; no threats, no undue influence.

- **Break-glass (legal)**
  - **Triggers:** Court order, injunction, subpoena.
  - **Quorum:** GC_Approver + Evidence_Custodian + Compliance_Officer.
  - **Aftercare:** Disclosure log; legal hold; review of scope creep.

## Adaptation to legal frameworks and defense-adjacent ecosystems

- **Corporate and public sector**
  - **NIST SP 800-53:** Map AC, AU, CM, IR, MP, PL, RA, SC families to controls in this manual.
  - **ISO/IEC 27001:** Annex A alignment for access, cryptography, ops, supplier, compliance.
  - **Privacy:** GDPR/CCPA data minimization; DSR workflows; records of processing.

- **Tax and financial**
  - **Standards:** IRS e-file/Publication 1075; SOX evidence integrity; SEC EDGAR for applicable filings.
  - **Controls:** Schema validation; numeric reconciliation; dual-control transmit; immutable receipts.

- **Export control and defense-adjacent constraints**
  - **Compliance:** ITAR/EAR jurisdiction screening; data residency and citizenship gating; need-to-know segregation.
  - **Environment labeling:** Mark environments with impact levels; constrain egress; use FIPS-validated crypto modules.
  - **Human-in-the-loop:** Human counsel required for any filing touching classified, export-controlled, or restricted topics.
  - **Prohibitions:** No generation of operational targeting, weaponization guidance, or evasion of oversight. This framework supports governance and compliance only.

- **Ecosystem fairness**
  - **Asset division logic:** Transparent formulas; appeal path; rights impact notes.
  - **Dispute resolution:** Mediation-first protocols; documented negotiation histories.

## Minimal runbook to implement

- **Policy load order:** Rights Charter → legallyblind manifest → OPA rules → WDAC/AppLocker baselines.
- **Key ceremonies:** Quarterly key rotation for sealing and transmit; dual custody; recovery drills.
- **Drills:** Simulate filing rejection, subpoena response, and rollback of an incorrect citation package.
- **KPIs:** Time-to-seal, review rejection rate, bias flags per 1,000 pages, chain-of-custody completeness, jurisdictional compliance pass rate.

If you share your current role directory, WDAC/AppLocker posture, and where policies live in your repos, I can produce precise, drop-in policy files, review checklists, and a first set of sealed templates for your counsel to approve.
