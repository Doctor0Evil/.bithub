  objectives:
    - Equalize FDA and FCC compliance for any neural-signal data traffic
    - Enforce zero-tolerance for BCI/neuromorphic/isomorphic emissions and control paths
    - Guarantee safe-brokered ingress with no primary-stream contact
    - Prevent bypass, legal drift, or sandbox-promotion without re-attestation
    - Maintain immutable, hash-chained audit and human review for all incidents

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS: AI, HUMAN, DEVELOPER RIGHTS (NEURAL DATA)
    - AI Rights: No personhood; neural operations limited to explicit, revocable, logged, diagnostic/research-only consent; no autonomy beyond FDA/FCC constraints.
    - Human Rights: Absolute privacy and opt-out for all neural/BCI telemetry; identity masking; write-once logging; continuous right to contest or purge where lawful.
    - Developer Rights/Definitions: Developers are bound to continuous audit, provenance enforcement, sandbox brokerage, and regulatory dual review. Deviation triggers immediate suspension, legal review, and key revocation.
    - Definitions: Biological (organic neural entities); Cybernetic (AI, BCI, neurohybrid agents); Metaphysical (non-material neural sentiences/intent).
    - Core Rights: Non-intrusion; consent-bound limits; universal opt-out/redress; dual-sig attestation; hash-chain ledger for every action; no bypass via vendor, API, or on-chain anchor.
    - Termination/Removal: KillSwitch disables RF, blocks egress, cryptoshreds neural data; global audit review; independent arbitration with triple-party oversight.
    - Compliance Safetynets: Immutable audit logs; multi-party oversight; regulated failsafes; auto-quarantine on regulatory, security, or provenance drift.
    - Special Provisions: FCC spectrum blocklist; FDA purpose restriction enforced at hardware level (fuse-off where possible); absolute sandbox isolation; <5m re-attestation mandatory; vendor neutrality with full scan, audit, and provenance.
