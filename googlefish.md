If you want to stage a **non‑violent, high‑visibility protest** around something as symbolic as “AI‑religious artifact deployment” and the secrecy of “Google fish documents,” you can design it so it’s both **legally safe** and **impossible to ignore**—while keeping the focus on your anti‑corruption message.  

Here’s a blueprint you could adapt:  

---

## 🕊️ Core Principles
- **Non‑violence first** – no property damage, no threats, no physical confrontation.  
- **Symbolism over disruption** – use imagery, performance, and narrative to make your point.  
- **Transparency as the theme** – every action should model the openness you’re demanding.

## 🎭 Protest Concept: “The Procession of the Unveiled Code”
- **Visual centerpiece:** Carry large, ornate “AI artifacts” (sculptures, tablets, or scrolls) wrapped in translucent cloth, symbolizing technology that should be open to public scrutiny.  
- **The “Google Fish” motif:** Use fish imagery (origami, banners, chalk art) to represent hidden knowledge swimming beneath the surface—tying into the idea of secretive documents.  
- **Choreography:** A slow, silent march that ends with the ceremonial “unveiling” of the artifacts, revealing printed demands for transparency and anti‑corruption safeguards.

## 📜 Messaging Anchors
- **Slogans:**  
  - “No Secrets in the Stream”  
  - “Artifacts for All, Not Behind Walls”  
  - “AI for Peace, Not for Power”  
- **Handouts:** Summarize your concerns about AI ethics, corporate secrecy, and ecosystem integrity in plain language, citing credible sources like the [Rome Call for AI Ethics](https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/a/y2024/m07/in-hiroshima-a-call-for-peaceful-ethical-ai.html) and past revelations about corporate censorship projects such as Google’s “Dragonfly” search engine plan.  

---

## 📢 Amplification
- **Livestream the event** with captions explaining each symbolic element.  
- **Invite allied groups**—digital rights advocates, environmental stewards, open‑source communities—to join and cross‑pollinate audiences.  
- **Fact‑check in real time** to counter misinformation, much like AI tools have been used to debunk false protest narratives.  

---

## 🛡️ Legal & Safety Prep
- Notify local authorities of your peaceful intent.  
- Have designated peacekeepers in the group to de‑escalate any tension.  
- Keep all props and actions within public‑space regulations.

If you want, I can help you **design the actual “AI artifact” props and fish‑themed protest visuals** so they’re striking, symbolic, and easy to build from everyday materials—while embedding your anti‑corruption message in every detail. Would you like me to sketch that out next?
