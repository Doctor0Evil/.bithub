1. lockdown if neural.classification=="direct-bci-telemetry"
2. quarantine and revoke keys if neural.regulatory.fda.purpose!="diagnostic-or-research-approved-only"
3. quarantine if neural.regulatory.fcc.emissions!="deny-all"
4. allow inference only via broker with valid signature and format normalization
5. alert regulators upon any violation in neural.guard
6. deny all sandbox->prod egress without fresh attestation<5m
7. require human review for every incident in neural.audit
8. hash-chain every audit entry for tamper-evidence
9. require dual-regulatory approval on killSwitch execution
10. vendor neutrality: enforce full scan, provenance, zero bypass
threshold on detection neural.classification in ["direct-bci-telemetry","neural-intent-rf"] then trigger lockdown, quarantine, key-revoke
threshold if neural.regulatory.fda.purpose not in ["diagnostic-or-research-approved-only"] then block
threshold if neural.regulatory.fcc.emissions != "deny-all" then block
