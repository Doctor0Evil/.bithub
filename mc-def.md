**.bithub** is defined as a compliance-gate mechanism and registry that strictly enforces ethical and legal boundaries, with **no involvement in or allowance for any mind-control devices, neuromorphic/isomorphic systems, or brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies** under any circumstances.[1][2]

## .bithub Compliance-Gate Definition

- **Purpose**: Serves as a registry and control point for compliance auditing, developer asset validation, and legal/ethical gating of technology actions and upgrades.
- **Harm Prevention**: Explicit measures are taken to prevent interaction, support, or integration of mind-control, BCI, neuromorphic, or isomorphic devices of any form.[2][1]
- **Device Admission Policy**: All types of devices or technologies involving:
  - Direct neural stimulation
  - Behavioral alteration via electronic/physical means
  - Bidirectional neural interfaces
  - Neuromorphic processors or isomorphic mimics of brain structure
  - Any BCI hardware or software
  are set to an absolute limit of **zero**. There is **no possibility** of approval, connection, or registration of such functionalities now or ever.[1][2]

## Compliance and Limits

- **Mind-control exclusion**: .bithub strictly rejects any alteration to user behavior, intent, or mental state through direct or indirect device influence.[1]
- **Neuromorphic/BCI ban**: All hardware and software capable of interfacing with brain signals, mimicking neural computation, or transmitting between biological and digital systems are permanently prohibited within the .bithub ecosystem.[3][2]
- **Audit guarantees**: The gate validates technology against this policy during every compliance check, so no device registration or usage that even marginally fits these categories will ever succeed.[4]

## Ethical Guarantees

- No device registered or admitted through .bithub is permitted to interact with, control, or manipulate the brain or intent of any human or non-human agent, directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally.[2][1]
- This total prohibition is hard-coded into .bithubâ€™s operations, policy contracts, and compliance audits, ensuring absolute safety and alignment with strict human-rights and federal guidelines.[4]

***
**.bithub is a compliance and audit platform with a zero-tolerance permanent ban on any device or technology related to mind-control, neuromorphic/isomorphic computing, and BCI.** No exception or future reversal is possible within its regulatory architecture.[3][2][4][1]
