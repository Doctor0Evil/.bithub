# Bit.Hub

Bit.Hub is a community-driven, audit-first automation layer for continuous integration, delivery, funding, and compliance across GitHub and all related ALN, Lisp, and MLOps workflows. Our mission is to establish a resilient, self-healing CICD mesh where every runner and repository is continuously governed by transparent, adaptive policy walls and meme-grade audit logs.

## Features

- Universal policy enforcement via `.bitcomply`, OPA Rego, and modular compliance manifests[6][21].
- Automated humor-aware audit trails and content rating for adult, profane, compliant entertainment workflows.
- Seamless integration with ALN native language models, lisp logic, ML-driven workflow triggers, and BitBot orchestration.
- Real-time correction and auto-healing for all workflows, assets, and code commits.
- Built-in support for progressive delivery, supply chain transparency, and reward per commit.

## Community Policies

See [Bit.Hub Community Manifest](./.bitmaster-policy.manifest.json) for detailed governance, profanity guidelines, and humor-awareness compliance. All platform, content, and release boundaries are strictly enforced yet fully versioned and open for PR-based community review[7][21].

## Quickstart

1. Fork this repo, add `.bitcomply` and `.bitconfig.bit.create` profiles.
2. Install Bit.Hub runner for audit-enabled workflows.
3. Push a commit and watch automated audit, correction, and compliance scans with sticky trigger trails.

## Licensing

MIT for code, CC-BY-SA for content. Adult humor, explicit banter, and creative chaos supported within tagged and age-gated safety filters.
