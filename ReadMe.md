# Bit.Hub ‚Äì Advanced Governance & Ethical Cybernetics Platform

## Overview

Bit.Hub is a **federated, compliance-first platform** designed for secure, ethical, and transparent management of **AI, BCI, and cybernetic systems**.
It integrates advanced governance, audit, and privacy protocols to ensure:

* Maximum **ethical safety**
* **Neural integrity**
* **Cybernetic non-interference**

This repository serves as the **core framework** for:

* Research
* Monitoring
* Orchestration of **AI-BCI compliance workflows**

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Neural Integrity & Ethical AI Protection**
  Prevents AI systems from interacting with neural signals or BCI devices outside federally approved medical research contexts.

* **Cybernetic Non-Interference**
  Strict prohibition of augmentation or manipulation in AI interactions, enforced in real time.

* **Federated Governance & Audit**
  Immutable logging, blockchain-anchored compliance, and transparent operations.

* **Web5 Transition**
  Gradual removal of Web3 dependencies, enabling secure integration with next-generation decentralized protocols.

* **Privacy-Centric Design**
  GDPR-compliant, zero-trust data handling, end-to-end encryption.

* **Coordinated Vulnerability & Incident Response**
  CVD templates, risk assessments, and defensive action frameworks integrated with **ALN/Bit.Hub** manifest standards.

* **Global Compliance & Ethical Oversight**
  Aligned with **NIST, FDA, ISO, GDPR**, neurorights, and ethical AI principles.
