  objectives:
    - Equalize FDA and FCC compliance for any neural-signal data traffic
    - Enforce zero-tolerance for BCI/neuromorphic/isomorphic emissions and control paths
    - Guarantee safe-brokered ingress with no primary-stream contact
    - Prevent bypass, legal drift, or sandbox-promotion without re-attestation
    - Maintain immutable, hash-chained audit and human review for all incidents

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS: AI, HUMAN, DEVELOPER RIGHTS (NEURAL DATA)
    - AI Rights: No personhood; neural operations limited to explicit, revocable, logged, diagnostic/research-only consent; no autonomy beyond FDA/FCC constraints.
    - Human Rights: Absolute privacy and opt-out for all neural/BCI telemetry; identity masking; write-once logging; continuous right to contest or purge where lawful.
    - Developer Obligations: Continuous audit, provenance enforcement, sandbox brokerage, dual review. Deviation triggers immediate suspension, legal review, and key revocation.
    - Definitions: Biological (organic neural entities); Cybernetic (AI, BCI, neurohybrid agents); Metaphysical (non-material neural sentiences/intent).
    - Core Rights: Non-intrusion; consent-bound limits; universal opt-out/redress; dual-sig attestation; hash-chain ledger for every action; no bypass via vendor, API, or on-chain anchor.
    - Termination/Removal: KillSwitch disables RF, blocks egress, cryptoshreds neural data; global audit review; independent arbitration with triple-party oversight.
    - Compliance Safetynets: Immutable audit logs; multi-party oversight; regulated failsafes; auto-quarantine on regulatory, security, or provenance drift.
    - Special Provisions: FCC spectrum blocklist; FDA purpose restriction enforced at hardware level (fuse-off where possible); absolute sandbox isolation; <5m re-attestation mandatory; vendor neutrality with full scan, audit, and provenance.

Bit.Hub – Advanced Governance & Ethical Cybernetics Platform

Overview

Bit.Hub is a federated, compliance-first platform designed for secure, ethical, and transparent management of AI, BCI, and cybernetic systems. It integrates advanced governance, audit, and privacy protocols to ensure maximum ethical-safety, neural integrity, and cybernetic non-interference. This repository serves as the core framework for research, monitoring, and orchestration of AI-BCI compliance workflows.

Key Features

Neural Integrity & Ethical AI Protection
Ensures no AI system interacts with neural signals or BCI devices outside of federally approved medical research contexts.

Cybernetic Non-Interference
Strict prohibition of cybernetic augmentation or manipulation in AI interactions, with real-time enforcement of compliance rules.

Federated Governance & Audit
Immutable logging and blockchain-anchored compliance for transparent, accountable operations.

Web5 Transition
Slowly removes Web3 dependencies while ensuring secure and compliant integration with next-generation decentralized protocols.

Privacy-Centric Design
GDPR-compliant data handling, zero-trust principles, and end-to-end encryption for all sensitive workflows.

Coordinated Vulnerability & Incident Response
Full CVD templates, risk assessment, and defensive action frameworks integrated with ALN and Bit.Hub manifest standards.

Global Compliance & Ethical Oversight
Designed to align with NIST, FDA, ISO, and international human-rights frameworks, including neurorights and ethical AI principles.
