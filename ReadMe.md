Bit.Hub: Compliance-First Orchestration & AI-Native CI/CD
Bit.Hub is a community-driven, compliance-first automation and orchestration platform. It's designed to empower secure, scalable, and legally compliant CI/CD pipelines across GitHub and federated virtual machine clusters. Bit.Hub provides a living, self-healing ecosystem that governs workflows, runners, containers, and content‚Äîenabling advanced AI-driven game development universes while ensuring strict adherence to regulatory and platform policies.

üöÄ Key Features
Universal Compliance Core: Centralized manifests and Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies enforce workflow hygiene, runner labeling, container image standards, and content moderation, including profanity-aware controls and availability.

Humor-Reasoning Model: An intelligent enforcement escalation based on commit messages and code changes that supports safe adult humor and profane-but-compliant content in fictional contexts.

Self-Healing Meta-Corrector: Automatically normalizes workflows, injects required permissions, concurrency, and timeouts, upgrades deprecated actions, and opens pull requests with fixes.

Container Compliance Wall: Blocks container image publishing if policy violations or unsafe labels/tags are detected.

Federated Runner Mesh: Supports GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners with strict label enforcement to prevent unauthorized or non-compliant execution.

Multi-Language & Toolchain Support: Seamlessly integrates ALN, Lisp, Go, Batchfile, LOL.LANG, and other ecosystems with modular, policy-driven pipelines.

Audit Trails & Event Logging: All compliance decisions, workflow corrections, and humor-driven escalations are logged in tamper-evident ledgers and JSONL event streams.

Community-Led Governance: Policies and manifests are versioned and open for pull request contributions, enabling transparent evolution and shared ownership.

üì¶ Getting Started
Prerequisites
A GitHub account with repository access.

GitHub Actions enabled on your repository.

A GITHUB_TOKEN or Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate scopes.

Optional: Self-hosted runners labeled with bit.hub for workload segregation.

Installation
Clone the Bit.Hub repository to sync canonical policies and manifests.

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Doctor0Evil/Bit.Hub.git
Integration
Sync Bit.Hub Policies: Add a step in your CI/CD workflows to clone and sync policies from the canonical Bit.Hub repository, ensuring your runners always enforce the latest rules.

Use Meta-Corrector Workflow: Enable the Meta-Corrector Workflow in your repository to continuously auto-fix and audit your workflows.

Deploy Humor-Reasoning Orchestrator: Use the Humor-Reasoning Orchestrator to dynamically adjust enforcement thresholds based on commit content and trigger downstream compliance jobs.

Enforce Container Compliance Wall: Integrate the Container Compliance Wall to block unsafe container image pushes.

Implement Go Environment Schema & Policy: Validate Go-based pipelines against the provided schema and OPA policy to ensure strict compliance in your game development pipelines.

üìö Documentation & Resources
Policies: Located in the .bithub/policy/ directory, including workflow, runner, container, content, availability, and humor policies.

Enforcement Manifests: .bit/master-policy.aln and related .bit/enforcement.*.bit files define enforcement scopes and thresholds.

Compliance Workflows: Ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflows that synchronize policies, audit, self-heal, and enforce compliance.

Humor & Profanity Guidelines: Policies and banter matrices ensure the safe deployment of adult humor and profane content.

Audit & Logging: JSONL event streams and ledger files for traceability and forensic analysis.

üõ°Ô∏è Compliance & Security
Bit.Hub enforces:

GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOC2, ISO27001, and HIPAA where applicable.

Strict content moderation with fictional and age-gated metadata tagging.

Immutable audit trails for all compliance decisions.

Automated remediation and pull request creation for non-compliant workflows.

Runner authorization and label enforcement to prevent unauthorized execution.
