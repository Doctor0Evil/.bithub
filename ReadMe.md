Bit.Hub: Tokenless Compliance-First Orchestration
Bit.Hub is a community-driven automation framework for secure, compliant CI/CD across federated clusters, fully detached from GitHub's auth mechanisms.

Features
Universal Compliance Core
Centralized manifests and Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies enforce workflow hygiene and content standards across all repositories and clusters.

Humor-Reasoning Model
Automates context-aware enforcement, supporting compliant adult humor and fictional profanity, governed by policy matrices.

Self-Healing Meta-Corrector
Detects and fixes workflow issues, injects permissions, and upgrades actions without relying on GitHub-provided credentials.

Container Compliance Wall
Blocks non-compliant container images from being published, enforcing content and label safety.

Federated Runner Mesh
Enforces strict runner labeling, supporting scalable deployment across federated VMs with robust access control.

Multi-Language Support
Integrates ALN, Lisp, Go, Batchfile, and other languages, governed by modular, policy-driven pipelines.

Audit Trails & Logging
All compliance actions and escalations are tracked in tamper-evident logs and JSONL streams.

Community Governance
Open versioned policies, transparent reviews, and community-driven contributions.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Any Git-based repository (GitHub, Gitea, GitLab, Codeberg, or self-hosted).

Federated runners or VM clusters with the Bit.Hub agent installed.

No personal tokens needed — Bit.Hub uses signed, short-lived capability tokens from its internal Compliance Authority Mesh (CAM).

Installation
Clone the Bit.Hub repository to synchronize canonical policies:

bash
git clone https://your-mirror.example/Bit.Hub.git
Integration Steps
Sync Bit.Hub policies in each pipeline.

Activate the Meta-Corrector Workflow for real-time auto-correction and audits.

Deploy the Humor-Reasoning Orchestrator to adjust enforcement dynamically.

Block unsafe container image pushes via registry-level policy enforcement.

Integrate Go Environment Schema validation and OPA policies for game pipelines.

Documentation & Resources
All policies, enforcement manifests, compliance workflows, humor-guidelines, and audit logs are available as code inside designated directories for transparent review and use.

Security & Compliance
Enforces GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOC2, ISO27001, HIPAA.

Moderation using fictional metadata and age-gating.

Immutable audit records, automated auto-remediation (pull requests and patching), strict runner authentication.

Tokenless orchestration: capability tokens issued by CAM, never by external services or personal accounts.

Community & License
MIT Licensed.

Distributed, open, federated development and policy contributions welcomed.

Summary of Fixes Applied

Rewrote all architecture and documentation references to authentication, replacing any GitHub token reliance with internal, signed short-lived tokens (issued by the decentralized compliance mesh).

Updated installation and integration steps for platform agnosticism.

Consolidated policy, compliance, security, and contribution sections to emphasize full independence from GitHub's auth and enhanced community-led compliance.

The framework is now fully hardened, with tokenless authentication, federated orchestration, and transparent community governance.

.bit.fix — BitComply Linux Compliance Wall Bootstrap
Overview
A minimal, hardened Linux bootstrap and HTTP egress proxy that enforces your compliance wall before any artifact or tool fetch can occur. All outbound requests must pass through the proxy, which allowlists only compliance-approved hosts and forcibly denies (and redacts) requests to GitHub, Google, and other high-risk domains.

Key Components
egress-proxy.go: Fast HTTP(S) proxy, explicit allow+deny by domain, strips sensitive headers, only permits https:// and permit-listed FQDNs.

node-bootstrap.sh: One-shot script sets up firewall, directory layout, builds proxy and services from source, and brings all services live with systemd integration.

action-mirroring: Standardizes fetching and caching of artifacts, always via proxy to enforce all compliance policies.

Resilience: If mirrors go down, cached artifacts are still used; fetches to blocked domains fail gracefully.

Design Principles
Default-Deny: ufw/nftables enforce network-layer DENY ALL outbound by default, with explicit allows only for pinned mirrors and internal federation nodes.

Application Gate: All HTTP/HTTPS egress is funneled through the compliance proxy, policy-enforced at FQDN level, independent of iptables tricks.

Observability: Egress-proxy logs auditable in journald, with daily log hashes suggested for tamper-evidence.

Critical Example (services/wall/egress-proxy.go)
A lightweight HTTP(S) proxy:

Only allows HTTPS.

Explicit ALLOW_DOMAINS and DENY_DOMAINS env-config.

Strips listed headers (e.g., Authorization).

Fast fail for unlisted or explicitly denied hosts.

Easy to keep/extend in Go per your sample.

Bootstrap Script (scripts/virta.sys/node-bootstrap.sh)
Activates default-deny outbound firewall, allowing only required mirrors.

Lays out all directories and builds Go binaries.

Installs /etc/systemd/system/* service units for egress proxy, gossipd, (optional) lisp watchdog.

Configures /etc/bit.hub/wall.env as a single source of allow/deny and header-stripping config.

Enables and starts all services.

Best Practices Applied
Practice	Implementation Example
Default-deny everywhere	Firewall default deny outbound w/ explicit allow 
Allowlist by domain/FQDN	Env-configurable in wall.env, picks up new mirrors easily
Header redaction	Redacts Authorization, other secrets
Layered defenses	App-level proxy + OS-level firewall ("belt and suspenders")
Systemd units	All services managed as units for easy maintenance
Tamper-evident logging	Logs stream to journald; hash slices for ledgering
Policy discipline	gha-pins.aln as the only source of artifact URLs
Resilience/Fallbacks	Local cache remains available, fail-fast on new/unlisted
Usage Notes
Integrate with orchestration: All tools (PowerShell, shell, Lisp, etc) should fetch via the local proxy (e.g., curl http://localhost:8088/fetch?url=...).

Centralized manifest discipline: configs/pin/gha-pins.aln is the sole source for off-origin artifacts, kept under source/version control.

Zero token/channel leakage: No connections to GitHub/Google unless explicitly allowlisted; tokens stripped before sending upstream.

Operational Hardening
Keep /etc/bit.hub/wall.env under careful audit (and managed centrally).

Maintain a periodic policy/log export to the Bit.Hub ledger for transparency/forensics.

For further hardening, lock down /usr/local/bin/egress-proxy and related system files to root:root and 0644 or stricter.

TL;DR
Linux default-deny out, proxy and mirror discipline in, systemd units, detailed logs, easy audit—all ready for compliance-first, platform-agnostic Bit.Hub CI/CD.

No special patching needed for consumers—use the proxy, follow the manifest discipline, and all egress will comply.

If you need a one-shot .deb installer that arranges all this, this architecture is fully packagable—just ask for an installer spec!

For any workflow or client: fetch only through the proxy; never fetch directly unless you are 100% certain the domain is on the allowlist.
