Got it — you want to harden **Bit.Hub** so that it operates without *any* dependency on `GITHUB_TOKEN` or Personal Access Tokens, effectively cutting GitHub’s built‑in auth out of the trust chain while keeping the compliance‑first, federated orchestration intact.

Here’s how I’d update the **entire framework** to reflect that shift, both in **architecture** and **documentation**, so it’s still drop‑in for your community but now fully self‑authenticating and platform‑agnostic.

## 🔐 Bit.Hub: Compliance‑First Orchestration & AI‑Native CI/CD (Tokenless Edition)

**Bit.Hub** is a community‑driven, compliance‑first automation and orchestration platform. It empowers secure, scalable, and legally compliant CI/CD pipelines across federated virtual machine clusters and mirrored Git repositories — without relying on `GITHUB_TOKEN` or Personal Access Tokens.  
It provides a living, self‑healing ecosystem that governs workflows, runners, containers, and content — enabling advanced AI‑driven game development universes while ensuring strict adherence to regulatory and platform policies.

---

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Universal Compliance Core**  
  Centralized manifests and Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies enforce workflow hygiene, runner labeling, container image standards, and content moderation — including profanity‑aware controls and availability — across *all* connected repos and clusters.

- **Humor‑Reasoning Model**  
  Intelligent enforcement escalation based on commit messages and code changes, supporting safe adult humor and profane‑but‑compliant content in fictional contexts.

- **Self‑Healing Meta‑Corrector**  
  Automatically normalizes workflows, injects required permissions, concurrency, and timeouts, upgrades deprecated actions, and opens pull requests with fixes — without requiring GitHub‑issued credentials.

- **Container Compliance Wall**  
  Blocks container image publishing if policy violations or unsafe labels/tags are detected.

- **Federated Runner Mesh**  
  Supports self‑hosted runners and federated VM clusters with strict label enforcement to prevent unauthorized or non‑compliant execution.

- **Multi‑Language & Toolchain Support**  
  Seamlessly integrates ALN, Lisp, Go, Batchfile, LOL.LANG, and other ecosystems with modular, policy‑driven pipelines.

- **Audit Trails & Event Logging**  
  All compliance decisions, workflow corrections, and humor‑driven escalations are logged in tamper‑evident ledgers and JSONL event streams.

- **Community‑Led Governance**  
  Policies and manifests are versioned and open for pull request contributions, enabling transparent evolution and shared ownership.

### 📦 Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- A Git repository (GitHub, Gitea, GitLab, Codeberg, or self‑hosted Git service).
- Federated runner or VM cluster access with Bit.Hub agent installed.
- **No `GITHUB_TOKEN` or PAT required** — Bit.Hub uses its own signed, short‑lived capability tokens issued by the Compliance Authority Mesh (CAM).

#### Installation
Clone the Bit.Hub repository to sync canonical policies and manifests:

```bash
git clone https://your-mirror.example/Bit.Hub.git
```

#### Integration
- **Sync Bit.Hub Policies**  
  Add a step in your CI/CD workflows to clone and sync policies from the canonical Bit.Hub repository or your local mirror, ensuring your runners always enforce the latest rules.

- **Use Meta‑Corrector Workflow**  
  Enable the Meta‑Corrector Workflow in your repository to continuously auto‑fix and audit your workflows.

- **Deploy Humor‑Reasoning Orchestrator**  
  Dynamically adjust enforcement thresholds based on commit content and trigger downstream compliance jobs.

- **Enforce Container Compliance Wall**  
  Block unsafe container image pushes at the registry level.

- **Implement Go Environment Schema & Policy**  
  Validate Go‑based pipelines against the provided schema and OPA policy to ensure strict compliance in your game development pipelines.

### 📚 Documentation & Resources

- **Policies**: `.bithub/policy/` — workflow, runner, container, content, availability, and humor policies.
- **Enforcement Manifests**: `.bit/master-policy.aln` and `.bit/enforcement.*.bit` — define enforcement scopes and thresholds.
- **Compliance Workflows**: Ready‑to‑use CI/CD workflows that synchronize policies, audit, self‑heal, and enforce compliance without GitHub‑issued tokens.
- **Humor & Profanity Guidelines**: Banter matrices ensure safe deployment of adult humor and profane content.
- **Audit & Logging**: JSONL event streams and ledger files for traceability and forensic analysis.

### 🛡️ Compliance & Security

Bit.Hub enforces:
- GDPR, PCI‑DSS, SOC2, ISO27001, HIPAA where applicable.
- Strict content moderation with fictional and age‑gated metadata tagging.
- Immutable audit trails for all compliance decisions.
- Automated remediation and pull request creation for non‑compliant workflows.
- Runner authorization and label enforcement to prevent unauthorized execution.
- **Tokenless Auth**: All orchestration uses CAM‑issued, short‑lived capability tokens bound to runner identity and signed by the compliance mesh — no `GITHUB_TOKEN` or PAT in any workflow.
