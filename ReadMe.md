### 📦 What is Bit.Hub?

Bit.Hub is a **secure, cross-platform Git automation and credential storage platform** with modular, self-healing workflow suites, adaptive bots, and developer-friendly orchestration.  
**Mission:** Replace legacy workflow systems with composable, expressive automation for code, assets, bots, audits, and recovery.

### ⚙️ Automated Recovery & Hotpatch Flows (.bitddown)

When a workflow fails or expires:  
1. `.bitddown` scans `.github/workflows/` for expired cron/failure flags  
2. Repairs with `.bitddown-recover.sh` and updates registry logs  
3. Hotpatches can be triggered via `.bitworkflow-hotpatch.yml`  
4. Automated onboarding routines sync contributors and bots to `.bithub` for compliance

### 🧠 Contributor Onboarding & Banter Filtration

Start with:  
- `.bithub-actions/variable-parser-correct.yml`
- `.bithub-actions/bitbot-integrations.yml`
- `.bit.hub` manifest for quick repo mapping and compliance rules  
- Security policy: See `SECURITY.md`

**Bot personas:** BitBot, BanterSafe, ALNFantasia—available in `.bithub-actions` and `bithub/scripts/`.

### 🔒 Security & Governance

- Full compliance with [Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/Doctor0Evil/Bit.Hub/blob/main/LICENSE)
- Security measures via `SECURITY.md`
- Autonomous safety filter pipelines for advanced audit
- Banter, profanity, and permission filters throughout all content workflows

***

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Clone the repo and view `.bit.hub` for index/registry
- Use `continuous_loops.yml` to start recursive patching
- Schedule automatic repair with `.bitddown`
- Onboard contributors via `.bithub` and sync bots/audit trails

**For failed workflows:**  
- Check `.bitrecovery` and `.bitddown-recover.sh` before manual interventions.
