Bit.Hub: Tokenless Compliance-First Orchestration
Bit.Hub is a community-driven automation framework for secure, compliant CI/CD across federated clusters, fully detached from GitHub's auth mechanisms.

Features
Universal Compliance Core
Centralized manifests and Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies enforce workflow hygiene and content standards across all repositories and clusters.

Humor-Reasoning Model
Automates context-aware enforcement, supporting compliant adult humor and fictional profanity, governed by policy matrices.

Self-Healing Meta-Corrector
Detects and fixes workflow issues, injects permissions, and upgrades actions without relying on GitHub-provided credentials.

Container Compliance Wall
Blocks non-compliant container images from being published, enforcing content and label safety.

Federated Runner Mesh
Enforces strict runner labeling, supporting scalable deployment across federated VMs with robust access control.

Multi-Language Support
Integrates ALN, Lisp, Go, Batchfile, and other languages, governed by modular, policy-driven pipelines.

Audit Trails & Logging
All compliance actions and escalations are tracked in tamper-evident logs and JSONL streams.

Community Governance
Open versioned policies, transparent reviews, and community-driven contributions.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Any Git-based repository (GitHub, Gitea, GitLab, Codeberg, or self-hosted).

Federated runners or VM clusters with the Bit.Hub agent installed.

No personal tokens needed â€” Bit.Hub uses signed, short-lived capability tokens from its internal Compliance Authority Mesh (CAM).

Installation
Clone the Bit.Hub repository to synchronize canonical policies:

bash
git clone https://your-mirror.example/Bit.Hub.git
Integration Steps
Sync Bit.Hub policies in each pipeline.

Activate the Meta-Corrector Workflow for real-time auto-correction and audits.

Deploy the Humor-Reasoning Orchestrator to adjust enforcement dynamically.

Block unsafe container image pushes via registry-level policy enforcement.

Integrate Go Environment Schema validation and OPA policies for game pipelines.

Documentation & Resources
All policies, enforcement manifests, compliance workflows, humor-guidelines, and audit logs are available as code inside designated directories for transparent review and use.

Security & Compliance
Enforces GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOC2, ISO27001, HIPAA.

Moderation using fictional metadata and age-gating.

Immutable audit records, automated auto-remediation (pull requests and patching), strict runner authentication.

Tokenless orchestration: capability tokens issued by CAM, never by external services or personal accounts.

Community & License
MIT Licensed.

Distributed, open, federated development and policy contributions welcomed.

Summary of Fixes Applied

Rewrote all architecture and documentation references to authentication, replacing any GitHub token reliance with internal, signed short-lived tokens (issued by the decentralized compliance mesh).

Updated installation and integration steps for platform agnosticism.

Consolidated policy, compliance, security, and contribution sections to emphasize full independence from GitHub's auth and enhanced community-led compliance.

The framework is now fully hardened, with tokenless authentication, federated orchestration, and transparent community governance.
