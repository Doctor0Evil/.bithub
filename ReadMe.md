# Bit.Hub

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Bit.Hub is a **community-driven, compliance-first automation and orchestration platform** designed to empower secure, scalable, and legally compliant CI/CD pipelines across GitHub and federated virtual machine clusters. It provides a **living, self-healing ecosystem** that governs workflows, runners, containers, and content‚Äîenabling advanced AI-driven game development universes like ALNFantasia and fan.asia tools while ensuring strict adherence to regulatory and platform policies.

## üöÄ Features

- **Universal Compliance Core**  
  Centralized manifests and Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies enforce workflow hygiene, runner labeling, container image standards, content moderation (including profanity-aware controls), and availability.

- **Humor-Reasoning Model**  
  Intelligent enforcement escalation based on commit messages and code changes, supporting safe adult humor and profane-but-compliant content in fictional contexts.

- **Self-Healing Meta-Corrector**  
  Automatically normalizes workflows, injects required permissions, concurrency, and timeouts, upgrades deprecated actions, and opens pull requests with fixes.

- **Container Compliance Wall**  
  Blocks container image publishing if policy violations or unsafe labels/tags are detected.

- **Federated Runner Mesh**  
  Supports GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners with strict label enforcement to prevent unauthorized or non-compliant execution.

- **Multi-Language & Toolchain Support**  
  Seamlessly integrates ALN, Lisp, Go, Batchfile, LOL.LANG, and other ecosystems with modular, policy-driven pipelines.

- **Audit Trails & Event Logging**  
  All compliance decisions, workflow corrections, and humor-driven escalations are logged in tamper-evident ledgers and JSONL event streams.

- **Community-Led Governance**  
  Policies and manifests are versioned and open for pull request contributions, enabling transparent evolution and shared ownership.

## üì¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GitHub account with repo access.
- GitHub Actions enabled on your repository.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` or Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate scopes.
- Optional: Self-hosted runners labeled with `bit.hub` for workload segregation.

### Installation

Clone the Bit.Hub repository to sync canonical policies and manifests:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Doctor0Evil/Bit.Hub.git
‚öôÔ∏è Integration
1. Sync Bit.Hub Policies in Your Repo
Add a step in your CI/CD workflows to clone and sync policies from the canonical Bit.Hub repo, ensuring your runners always enforce the latest rules.

2. Use Meta-Corrector Workflow
Enable the Meta-Corrector Workflow in your repo to auto-fix and audit your workflows continuously.

3. Deploy Humor-Reasoning Orchestrator
Use the Humor-Reasoning Orchestrator to dynamically adjust enforcement thresholds based on commit content and trigger downstream compliance jobs.

4. Enforce Container Compliance Wall
Integrate the Container Compliance Wall to block unsafe container image pushes.

5. Implement Go Environment Schema & Policy
Validate Go-based pipelines against the provided schema and OPA policy to ensure strict compliance in your game development pipelines.
