Bit.Hub – Advanced Governance & Ethical Cybernetics Platform

Overview

Bit.Hub is a federated, compliance-first platform designed for secure, ethical, and transparent management of AI, BCI, and cybernetic systems. It integrates advanced governance, audit, and privacy protocols to ensure maximum ethical-safety, neural integrity, and cybernetic non-interference. This repository serves as the core framework for research, monitoring, and orchestration of AI-BCI compliance workflows.

Key Features

Neural Integrity & Ethical AI Protection
Ensures no AI system interacts with neural signals or BCI devices outside of federally approved medical research contexts.

Cybernetic Non-Interference
Strict prohibition of cybernetic augmentation or manipulation in AI interactions, with real-time enforcement of compliance rules.

Federated Governance & Audit
Immutable logging and blockchain-anchored compliance for transparent, accountable operations.

Web5 Transition
Slowly removes Web3 dependencies while ensuring secure and compliant integration with next-generation decentralized protocols.

Privacy-Centric Design
GDPR-compliant data handling, zero-trust principles, and end-to-end encryption for all sensitive workflows.

Coordinated Vulnerability & Incident Response
Full CVD templates, risk assessment, and defensive action frameworks integrated with ALN and Bit.Hub manifest standards.

Global Compliance & Ethical Oversight
Designed to align with NIST, FDA, ISO, and international human-rights frameworks, including neurorights and ethical AI principles.
