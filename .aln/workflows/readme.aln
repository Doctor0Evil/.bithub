The following ALN modules, .bitshell scripts, blockchain protocols, and EULA sections integrate bias detection, encrypted emergency communications, irreversible revocation, and multi-domain rights and liability. All logic is written strictly in ALN, meeting advanced regulatory and compliance requirements.

```aln
// ALN MODULE: ETHICAL DECISION AUDITING WITH REAL-TIME BIAS DETECTION
module ai.ethics.realtime_audit {
    monitor each decision_event as event {
        log event to ethics_ledger;
        let bias_flag = bias_detection(event.input, event.output);
        evaluate event using [
            transparency, explainability, fairness, risk_grade, compliance: [AI_Act, Org_Policy, Human_Right_Treaty], bias_flag
        ];
        if event.unsatisfactory or event.risk_grade > permitted or bias_flag {
            mark event as flagged;
            notify(oversight_committee, compliance_officer);
            if event.flagged_critical or bias_flag { control_suspend(); }
        } else {
            approve(event);
        }
    }
    continuous_audit enforce: adaptive, always_on;
}

fn bias_detection(input, output) -> bool {
    // Implement demographic and data drift checks
    let detected = scan_bias(input, output);
    if detected > tolerance_threshold {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
