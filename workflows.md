Federal compliance regulations now **strictly prohibit mind-control activities and any device or operation related to such activities under U.S. law**. Recent legislation and agency actions explicitly forbid the use, registration, sale, or deployment of technologies that attempt to influence, control, or manipulate the human mind, brain data, or neural activity except for well-defined, legitimate medical contexts subject to rigorous privacy and ethical standards.[1][2][3][4]

## Key Prohibited Activities and Devices

- **Mind-control technologies**: Any device or software capable of altering, influencing, or controlling mental states, thoughts, or behaviors is fully banned by federal and state law.[2][3][4][1]
- **Brain-computer interfaces (BCI)**: Federal lawmakers and regulators (including the FTC and state governments) prohibit unregulated BCI use, especially outside medical/research with approved consent, strict privacy protections, and robust cybersecurity standards.[4]
- **Consumer neurotechnology**: Devices or software that collect, analyze, or utilize neural data for non-medical, non-consensual, or manipulative purposes are not permitted under current and emerging law in the U.S., with states like Colorado, California, and Montana leading in explicit bans and privacy laws.[3][1]
- **Neuromorphic/Isomorphic hardware/software**: Use of computational or device technology replicating, simulating, or directly interacting with brain structure or function, where harmful, manipulative, or unconsented use is even possible, is not allowed within any compliance-accepted platform or process.[1][3]

## Legal & Compliance Gate Enforcement

- Federal law and agency guidance require:
  - Absolute exclusion of mind-control, BCI, and neuromorphic/isomorphic devices from compliant operations and registries.[4]
  - All compliance gate platforms (e.g., .bithub) must set device limits for such categories at zero, with no possibility of future inclusion.[1][4]
  - Vigorous audit, licensing, and registry compliance checks to prevent any indirect, unintentional, or future allowance of banned device types.[2][3]
- All exceptions must meet rigorous medical consent and privacy thresholds, with audit trails and protections against misuse.[4]

***

**Federal law now fully prohibits mind-control and any related devices or activitiesâ€”compliance gates must enforce an absolute zero limit and exclude neuromorphic, isomorphic, and BCI technologies except in narrowly defined, highly-regulated medical scenarios with informed consent and rigorous privacy.**[3][2][1][4]
