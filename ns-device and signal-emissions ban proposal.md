A ban is proposed on **all signal emissions from electronic transmitters** detailed previously, but only in cases where such emissions are proven to interfere with **neural signaling** or cause disruption to neural activity in biological entities.[1][2][3]

### Rationale for the Targeted Ban

- **Scientific Evidence:** Studies have documented that electromagnetic and certain radiofrequency emissions can alter neurotransmitter balance, interfere with neural electrical activity, and affect synaptic function, leading to changes in brain physiology and potentially hazardous health effects.[3][1]
- **Human Rights and Neuroprotection:** Multiple states and regulatory bodies have begun to implement and propose laws to protect neural data and prevent unauthorized or unsafe neuro-interference from consumer and industrial electronic devices.[2][4]
- **Ethical Principle:** Only signal emissions conclusively demonstrated to cause measurable interference or risk to neural signaling are to be included in the banâ€”thus, blanket restrictions are avoided unless scientifically warranted.[1][3]

### Scope and Implementation

- **Device Classes Affected:** All devices emitting electromagnetic, RF, or electrical signals capable of neural interference, including transmitters used in communication, sensing, and consumer electronics, are subject to review and, upon verified interference, banned.[3][1]
- **Testing and Verification:** Regulatory protocols must verify interference with neural signaling using scientific criteria before enforcement, aligning with neuro-rights and health protection policies.[4][2]
- **Legal and Industry Compliance:** The ban will be enforced in accordance with evolving neural data and neuroprotection laws, with due process for technology providers to demonstrate safety or exemption.[2][4]

This proposal aligns with emerging neural data privacy regulations and advances a **precautionary and scientifically-grounded framework** for public health and rights protection in the age of pervasive electronic emissions.[4][1][2][3]
