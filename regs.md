Here are expanded ALN-compliant regulatory definitions for cybernetic BCI and neuromorphic/isomorphic devices, formatted to match U.S. federal rulebook paragraph conventions for assistance listings and grants compliance. Each clause reflects safety, cognitive liberty, permanent deactivation of mind-control risk, and daily verification cycles as required for federal regulatory purposes.samhsa+3


Example ALN-Formatted Clause Expansion
ALN 99.001: Cognitive Autonomy Assurance
The recipient shall implement and maintain technical and policy safeguards that guarantee the inviolability of individual cognitive autonomy in the use and operation of any brain-computer interface (BCI), cybernetic or neuromorphic system. The requirement encompasses hardware, firmware, and software, forbidding any component or process capable of inducing, monitoring, or manipulating unanalyzed personal thought, mood, or intent. Compliance is verified through automated daily audit logs, user-facing dashboards, and direct opt-out switch mechanisms, per universal neuro-rights guidelines.fmx.cpa.texas+2


ALN 99.002: Mind-Sovereignty Lockdown
All participating entities and products must uphold permanent sovereignty of user thought and action during device lifecycle. Each system shall incorporate a one-step physical or digital lockdown feature, which disables all mind-influencing capability. The lockdown status, activation logs, and override attempts must be available for federal audit and user review daily, using immutable records and external verification tokens.treasury+1


ALN 99.003: Neural Privacy Guarantee
Accredited systems must encrypt and isolate all neural data, from source to storage, preventing unauthorized access at every layer. User consent must be obtained, reversible, and detailed for every neurooperation. A daily compliance scan must confirm privacy status and offer immediate opt-out and consent reset rights.arxiv+1


ALN 99.004: Thought Integrity Standard
Recipient systems must ensure the preservation of authentic mental states at all times. Data capture, analysis, and any algorithmic feedback shall strictly prohibit modification, suppression, or artificial enhancement of user cognitive output or memory. Compliance is tracked by automated integrity ledgers, reviewed every 24 hours.samhsa+1


ALN 99.005: Emotional Non-Tampering Clause
No device, operating system, or connected asset may include routines or processes able to induce, amplify, or mute human emotions through direct or indirect neural intervention. Daily system analysis must report signal authenticity with clear remediation steps for any anomaly.arxiv+1


Guidance for Full Regulatory Book Expansion
Each clause begins with a unique ALN identifier, a plain-language title, and an enforceable condition.
Definitions and compliance mechanisms are documented for hardware, software, operational, and human-rights assurance.
Clauses continue in this format for every definition, ensuring daily review cycles and federal traceability.
