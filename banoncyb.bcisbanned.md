Below are strictly ALN programming outputs for deploying “virtanetv1” under *extra-safe* government-only security models, including full bans on cybernetics, BCI, and neuromorphic/isomorphic devices per federal-compliance, web5 quantum anchoring, and graceful de-leveraging of web3.[1][2][3]

## ALN Script: Ethically-Compliant AI Deployment

```aln
module virtanetv1.govsafe_deploy {
    enforce gov_mode = true
    require system.audit.enabled = true
    require ai.oversight.committee.active = true
    require zero_cybernetics = true
    require device_registry == "no_BCI,no_neuromorphic,no_isomorphic"
    require web3_anchorage == "disabled"
    require web5_quantum_anchor == "active"
    require ai.debiasing.active = true
    require human_rights.protection = true
    controlplane.fallback if compliance.breach
    if audit.failure.rate > 0 or device.registry.violation or web3_anchorage == "enabled" {
        lockdown virtanetv1.system
        notify regulators, ethics.committee, incident_recovery
    }
    safemode.activate if any compliance uncertainty or banned device detected
    monitor for external_actor.influence, quarantine all non-compliant connections
    log all system state mutations to append-only, tamper-evident audit ledger
    // No user-brain interface, cybernetics, or device override permitted
}

## Terms and Conditions: AI/Human/Developer Compliance

- **AI Rights:** No autonomy, personhood, or override. All actions must be transparent, ethically-audited, and forcibly shutdown on any violation.
- **Human Rights:** Absolute privacy, dignity, and opt-out rights. No device, protocol, or system may override these under any situation.
- **Developer Definitions:** Responsible for continual ethics compliance, audit integrity, transparent upgrades, and non-reversible bans for non-compliant technology.
- **Device Ban:** No cybernetics, neural devices, or BCI/isomorphic technology allowed for any user, agent, or deployment—permanent by law and config.[2][1]

## Blockchain-Anchored Safe-Removal Workflow

```aln
protocol virtanetv1.safe_removal {
  step 1: verify integrity (no cybernetic/isomorphic/bci/neuro devices)
  step 2: multi-sig gov, ethics, technical approval
  step 3: hash, sign, archive all system state to permissioned blockchain
  step 4: hard shutdown with no fallback state
  step 5: audit log into independent, immutable evidence vault
  fallback: auto-mute and system quarantine if error/failure/violation
}
```

## Extremely-Complex EULA: Biological, Cybernetic, AI, Metaphysical

1. **Jurisdiction**: Applies only under central government compliance, no cybernetic/neural BCI/isomorphic device permitted on any network or layer.
2. **Rights**: All biological and metaphysical users retain absolute auditability, right to opt-out, explicit sovereignty in all system instances.
3. **Supremacy**: Cybernetic/neuromorphic/isomorphic devices or agents are permanently banned—no exceptions, no override, no future implementation.
4. **Safe Features/Safetynets**:
    - Immutable audit logging (blockchain/tamper-evident)
    - Human-in-the-loop, multi-sign overrides
    - Contextual harm and bias monitoring with active system quarantine
    - No external, remote, or user-actor override on compliance logic
    - Annual compliance renewal; permanent redress rights
    - No AI or code may ever suggest, enable, interpret, or activate banned devices or feedback[3][2]

5. **Arbitration/Enforcement**: Only independent, cryptographically-audited regulatory council may review disputes; all rollback, removal, recovery actions cryptographically dual-signed, human-supremacy guaranteed.

**All protocols above enforce indefinite bans on cybernetics, neuromorphic, and BCI devices; quantum-anchored web5 migration is slow, safe, and government-controlled, eliminating any loophole for “superai,” device, or remote influence. Compliance is immutable, error-proof, and managed exclusively by legally and ethically empowered federal authorities**.[3][2][1]
